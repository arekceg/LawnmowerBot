# LawnmowerBot
Simple facebook bot build with RestFB. 

The idea came to me when by some weird ad-targeting mischief I was bombarded with land mower ads and realized that they all look like they had distinct personalities. I thought it would be fun to assign them names, nicknames and therefore - a character.

In order to use the bot create:
* token file : file named "token" in the KosiarkaBot main directory. Paste your PageAuthToken here.
* pageid file : file named "pageid" in the KosiarkaBot main directory. Paste your Page Alias here.
