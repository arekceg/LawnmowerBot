## LawnmowerBot

Simple facebook bot build with RestFB. 

The idea came to me when, by some weird ad-targeting mischief, I was bombarded with land mower ads and realized that they all look like they had distinct personalities. I thought it would be fun to assign them names, nicknames and therefore - a character.

In order to use the bot create:
* **token** file : file named "**token**" in the LawnmowerBot main directory. Paste your PageAuthToken here.
* **pageid** file : file named "**pageid**" in the LawnmowerBot main directory. Paste your Page Alias here.

If you want to add more names etc, feel free to edit the files in wordSrc directory.
